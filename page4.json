No face swapping, no beautification, no AI smoothing, no stylization, and no alteration of identity.\n\nCreate an ultra-realistic, cinematic editorial portrait collage centered on a confident Indian woman wearing a traditional saree. The main subject stands gracefully in the foreground in full color, wearing a rich earthy-toned saree (warm brown, rust, or muted maroon shades) with natural fabric folds and realistic draping. Her posture is elegant and relaxed, one hand gently raised near her hair or neck, eyes softly closed or looking slightly upward, conveying calm confidence, self-love, and timeless beauty.\n\nSurrounding the central figure is a collage of multiple black-and-white portraits of the same woman in different candid moments and angles — reading, smiling softly, looking over her shoulder, seated casually, or standing near a railing. These monochrome images act as emotional memories and personality layers, framing the central color portrait without overpowering it.\n\nThe lighting is soft, cinematic, and natural — a blend of diffused daylight and gentle highlights that enhance skin realism and fabric texture. Shadows are smooth and realistic, with no harsh contrast. The background elements feel minimal, organic, and authentic, including subtle outdoor or balcony environments, blurred urban or natural backdrops, and soft depth-of-field.\n\nAdd delicate visual accents such as subtle floral elements near the top of the composition, light film grain, and gentle tonal contrast to enhance the editorial feel. Maintain photographic realism throughout — realistic skin pores, natural hair strands, accurate fabric weave, and lifelike proportions.\n\nOverall mood: elegant, soulful, feminine, timeless, and emotionally grounded. Style inspired by high-end Indian fashion editorials, cinematic portrait photography, and modern cultural storytelling. Aspect ratio vertical, high resolution, sharp focus, premium realism.",
