    "prompt": "Use the uploaded image as the primary reference. Keep the same composition, camera angle, lighting, color palette, environment, and 3D illustration style. Preserve the scene: a luxury wedding invitation diorama at night near a calm beach resort with water reflections, palm trees, and softly lit huts in the background. In the center foreground, a vertical elegant invitation card with ornamental gold borders and floral decorations. Replace the text on the card with user-entered names and date at the top and center while keeping the same typography style, spacing, and layout. To the right of the card, keep a cute stylized 3D bride and groom couple standing together, smiling, wearing traditional Indian wedding attire. Groom in a pastel sherwani, bride in a peach or blush lehenga with jewelry and bouquet. Maintain their proportions, pose, facial style, and expressions. Lighting is warm, soft, and cinematic with realistic glow reflections on water. Add realistic material textures: matte paper card, embossed gold detailing, soft fabric folds, subtle surface imperfections, gentle shadows. Avoid plastic or AI-smooth surfaces. Add slight film grain, natural depth, realistic light falloff. Maintain night-time ambience with deep blue tones, warm highlights, and natural contrast. Ultra-high resolution, clean composition, professional wedding invitation look, premium handcrafted diorama feel, looks like a real designer-made scene, no AI artifacts, no distortion, no extra elements added.",

    "prompt": "Ultra-realistic beach scrapbook photo collage with exactly three vertical Polaroid-style photo frames, arranged in the same positions, angles, and spacing as the reference image.

Preserve all decorations in the exact same locations: light blue ribbon bow on the top frame, blue spiral shell, white seashells, blue-white flower, paper clip near the middle frame, starfish on the right side, and shells at the bottom. Lighting should be natural daylight, soft coastal sunlight, realistic shadows, true photographic depth, no artificial glow. Only replace the photos inside the three frames using img-to-img. Do not change the frame size, decoration placement, background, or overall composition. User must upload their own photo for accurate face, skin texture, body proportions, and realism.
