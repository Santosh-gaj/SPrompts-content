The design features a soft, cinematic collage layout with multiple portraits of the same adult Indian man arranged in a grid-like background. The background images show him in different outfits and moods: holding a professional DSLR camera while smiling, standing casually in a white shirt outdoors, wearing a formal blazer, and relaxed candid poses. All background portraits must appear softly faded, partially desaturated, and blended together with smooth transitions, subtle blur, and pastel overlays in warm peach, beige, and light cream tones, creating a dreamy and nostalgic atmosphere.\n\nThe main subject is positioned prominently in the center foreground, shown from chest-up in side profile facing right. He has a well-groomed beard and mustache, medium-length hair tied back in a neat man bun, and is wearing round sunglasses with thin metal frames. His expression is calm, confident, and reflective. The main subject is rendered in sharper focus than the background, with higher contrast and clarity, while still maintaining a soft cinematic look. Clothing is a light-colored casual shirt with visible fabric texture.\n\nLighting is soft, diffused, and natural, with no harsh shadows. A gentle white glow and fog-like light bloom rises from the bottom of the image, partially fading the lower torso and blending smoothly into the background. Overall color grading is warm, muted, and elegant, with pastel highlights and low saturation.\n\nAt the bottom center, include elegant serif typography reading \"happy BIRTHDAY to you\". The word \"BIRTHDAY\" is large, uppercase, and bold in a classic serif font, colored deep teal or dark bluish-green. The words \"happy\" and \"to you\" are smaller, minimal, and placed above and to the right of the main word respectively, maintaining a clean editorial layout.\n\nThe entire poster should feel premium, emotional, and celebratory, suitable for a classy birthday tribute. Maintain the same framing, spacing, proportions, subject placement, background collage structure, glow intensity, and typography hierarchy exactly as the reference image. Ultra-detailed, photorealistic, professional poster design, smooth blending, perfect masking, high resolution, and clean edges.",
